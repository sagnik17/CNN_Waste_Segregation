### **Report your findings about the data**

1. The dataset contained **7,625 images** classified into **7 classes** ['Cardboard', 'Food_Waste', 'Glass', 'Metal', 'Other', 'Paper', 'Plastic'].
2. There is a **class imbalance**, where the **"Plastic"** class had **more than 2,000 images**, while all other classes had **1,000 or fewer**.
3. All images were of dimensions **256 Ã— 256** pixels.
4. All images resized to 128x128 to improve computational efficiency.
5. Dataset is split into 80% traning and 20% validation 
    - Training dataset size: 6100 images
    - Validation dataset size: 1525 images


### **Report model training results**

**Model Architecture**
- 3 **convolutional layers** with batch normalization, max pooling, and increasing dropout rates (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5).
- **Input size:** 128x128x3 RGB images.
- **Optimizer:** Adam (learning rate 0.0005).
- **Total parameters:** ~270K.
    - Total params: 269,767
    - Trainable params: 269,319
    - Non-trainable params: 448
- Fully connected output layer with softmax activation for 7 classes.

**Model Training**
- **Early stopping** and **learning rate reduction** callbacks helped prevent overfitting and stabilized training.
- Training and validation accuracy/loss plotted for monitoring.
- Model trained on 6,100 images, validated on 1,525 images.

**Evaluation**
- The CNN model achieved **70% accuracy** in classifying waste materials into seven categories.
- Accuracy and loss reported for both training and validation sets.
- The model performed best on "Cardboard" and "Metal" classes, with f1-scores above 0.74, while "Other" and "Paper" classes had lower scores, indicating room for improvement.
- Class imbalance was observed, with the "Plastic" class dominating the dataset. This affected the recall and precision for minority classes such as "Other" and "Paper".
- Classification report and confusion matrix generated for detailed performance analysis & future improvements.
